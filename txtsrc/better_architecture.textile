Title: Smaller code through better architecture

h1. Smaller code through better architecture

Mostly rant about how XML is a terrible data format. Example from Android (XML for tools, gets compiled to compact, binary format). An alternative: s-expr.

Maybe a mention of how designing protocols/data formats matter (by explaining how some existing protocols are bad e.g. MIME encoding is terribly wasteful (base64 encoding).
