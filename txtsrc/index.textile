h2. What is this about?

This document presents extreme techniques for optimizing the size of C, C++ and Objective-C programs. It's about optimizing both the size of the final executable and the amount of memory used at runtime.

Sometimes the code will also become faster, although speed is not the main focus.

All examples come from optimizing real-life code.
