Title: Measuring size

To cover:

* stripping symbols from binaries to get the real size. strip -S works everywhere, gcc -s on Linux but not on Mac
* using nm to see sizes of symbols
* using pdbdump.exe on windows
* my python scripts that use nm or pdbdump to show differences between two versions of the binary
