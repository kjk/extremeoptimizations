In 1985, more than 20 years ago, Commodore released Amiga 1000. It had
everything that a modern operating system of 2008 has: pre-emptive
multitasking, GUI subsystem, a mouse.

It’s successor, Amiga 500, ran on 7 MHz processor and 512 KB of RAM and
it ran fast.

It’s easy to accept that at the time of its release it was years ahead
of competition.

What’s harder to accept that in 2008 the memory of Amiga’s performance
shames the latest offering from Microsoft, that makes me wait before
showing a content of a directory on a hard-drive, despite having
hundreds times more memory and CPU cycles to spare.

Poor performance can be partially explained by bigger and more
complicated world today. Bigger screen resolutions mean more memory and
CPU cycles are needed to handle the display. Bigger hard-drives mean
more files which translates into more data we need to cache etc.

However, even bigger blame lays on the shoulders of countless
programmers who manage to starve the fastest CPUs and use up all the
memory through design and coding incompetence.

This book is for the few, the proud, who want to back that trend.

This book is for those who take professional pride in making the code
use the least amount of resources possible.

This book is for those for whom extreme is only the beginning.

Mobile & embedded markets.
--------------------------

They are growing and in mobile & embedded context small size and low
resource usage is important.

Free advertising from delighted users.
--------------------------------------

Users will notice that your application is smaller and faster than
competition. It will delight them and that will give them something to
talk about on their blogs =\> free advertising. Examples: Sumatra PDF,
uTorrent (?)
