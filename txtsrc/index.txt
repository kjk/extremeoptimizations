# Extreme (size) optimization in C, C++ and Objective-C. #

This website is about extreme size optimization of C/C++/Objective-C programs.

Table of contest.

What to cover:

* tools of the trade (using nm + python script with gcc, pdbdump + python script on windows)
* optimizing size of structures (by proper aligning of fields, packing)
* optimize arrays of structures by breaking them into arrays of smaller items
* 2 arrays of same size into one array
* passing structures by value (example from tinypy) - bad
