Title: Asking the compiler to optimize for you.

h1. Asking the compiler to optimize for you.

There are only two C/C++ compilers that matter: gcc and Visual Studio. Both have command-line options to optimize for the size of generated code.

For gcc it's @-Os@ option. It's an aggregate options which means that it enables few out of the million gcc optimization flags, those that aim at reducing the code size.

For Visual Studio's @cl.exe@, it's @/Os@.

The most common practice when building C/C++ software is to either build debug version (@-O0@ in gcc, @/Od@ in Visual C++) or optimized for speed release version (@-O2@ or @-O3@ in gcc, @/O2@ in @cl.exe@) and optimization for size is rarely used.

TODO: compile some largish program with various optimizations and report the differences.

TODO: mention thumb on ARM (saves 30% of code space, makes programs 30% slower)
