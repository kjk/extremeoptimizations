Title: Smaller code through better architecture

h1. Smaller code through better architecture

Mostly rant about how XML is a terrible data format. Example from Android (XML for tools, gets compiled to compact, binary format). An alternative: s-expr.

Maybe a mention of how designing protocols/data formats matter (by explaining how some existing protocols are bad e.g. MIME encoding is terribly wasteful (base64 encoding).

Mention exceptions etc. (example of how WebKit became much smaller after turning off exceptions - find a reference).
